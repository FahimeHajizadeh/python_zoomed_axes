# zoomtool.py — Draggable, Resizable Zoom Window for Matplotlib

A lightweight Python library that adds a **draggable, resizable zoom window** to any Matplotlib plot — similar to MATLAB’s zoomed inset feature.

This tool lets you:
- Click and drag a rectangle on your plot  
- Resize the rectangle interactively  
- Automatically view a zoomed version in a floating inset window  
- Compare overlapping or nearly identical signals easily  

This project is a **clean Python re-implementation** inspired by the MATLAB version released here:
